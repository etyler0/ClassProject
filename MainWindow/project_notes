Project notes:

- use linux version of qt

- read in info from file and display shapes in rendering windows

- alot of detail regarding shapes coming fromqt 2d rendering library

- basic drawing example is a tutorial under qt examples that includes documentation for 2d rendering library

- able to load basic drawing example into qt project

- The idea is to have a rendering window that will render all shapes in thw window

- should have a menu where we can add/remove shape

- posted in blackboard, our own custom vector implementation, modify the vector of doubles into a templated class

- we have shapes abstract base class, includes pure virtual functions draw, move and update

- base class shapes includes enum class shapetype that tells me what type of shape do i have, lists the shapes

- include protected qpainter& get_qpainter() in the base class

- each shape is a class that derive from the base class shapes, example. rectangle class derrives from shapes class

- indicate selected by drawing a bounding rectangle with a light neutral color

- update the hours tab in the sprint backlog
